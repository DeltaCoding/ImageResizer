# ImageResizer
A tool to resize images while keeping original resolution

## Disclaimer
Only input the things you are supposed to input (e.g. the resolution in the format WIDTHxHEIGHT), otherwise it will not work correctly. I do not take any responsibility if you accidentally check "Overwrite original file?".
